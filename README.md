# Natural-language-processing-NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of machine learning that makes it possible for computers to understand, analyze, manipulate and generate human language. You encounter NLP machine learning in your everyday life — from spam detection, to autocorrect, to your digital assistant (“Hey, Siri?”).

You may even encounter NLP and not even realize it. I’ll show you how to develop your own NLP projects with Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) but before let’s look at some every day examples of NLP. 

**EXAMPLES OF NLP MACHINE LEARNING**
* Email spam filters
* Auto-correct
* Predictive text
* Speech recognition
* Information retrieval
* Information extraction
